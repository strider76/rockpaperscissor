### How to Run
like a maven project in spring boot  we want run our Jar Project with the following command <br/>
`mvnw spring-boot:run` <br />

## User's manual
To user all the round's endpoints we need a user and login, the login endpoint gives you a JWT to use on each endpoint on the authorization header with the following format <br />
`bearer token` <br/>
we user the following Steps: <br>

1.**Create User**: we create a valid user (_not empty or null values in username in password_)<br>
**Endpoint**: POST /user/signup <br>
Request Body
```json
{
  "userName": "test",
  "password": "test"
}
```
The Response will be Http Code 201 (_Created_) <br/> and the user will be created in userList's bean
if username already exist will return a Http Code 400 (_Bad Request_) <br/> and a json with the description error<br/>
 
2.**Login User**: we sign in in the application, we chack that username exist in usrList's Bean and the password itÂ´s correct <br/>
**Endpoint**: GET /user/login <br>
Request Body
```json
{
  "userName": "test",
  "password": "test"
}
```
The Response will be Http Code 200 (_OK_) <br/> and well get the JWT in Authorization headers Response
if username or password it's incorrect  will return a Http Code 403 (_Forbidden_) <br/><br/>

On this point, we could use any Round's endpoind:<br/>
* **Play Round**: User Logged play a Round, we should attache in request Body the moves of players1 and Player2, and return the result Game<br />
**Endpoint**: POST /round/play <br>
Request Header: 'Authorization: Bearer _JWT value_'<br>
Request Body
```json
{
    "player1Move": "PAPER", // values [ROCK|PAPER|SCISSOR]
    "player2Move": "ROCK"   // values [ROCK|PAPER|SCISSOR]
}
```
So We Return the following Response<br>
Response Status: 201 Created <br>
Response Body
```json
{
    "player1Move": "PAPER",
    "player2Move": "ROCK",
    "result": "PLAYER1_WINS" // values [ PLAYER1_WINS | PLAYER2_WINS | DRAW ] 
}
```

 Response Status: 200 OK <br>

    "rounds": [       // visible user round's list order desc by created date 
        {
            "player1Move": "ROCK",
